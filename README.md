# Energy Consumption Forecasting
Introduction

## Significance of BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)
This approach provides a **strong architectural framework** for energy consumption forecasting using a **deep learning technique tailored for sequential data**. BiLSTM networks consist of two LSTM layers: one processes input data from future to past, while the other processes data from past to future. This bidirectional structure captures intricate temporal linkages and dependencies in both directions, making it highly effective for volatile and nonlinear energy consumption patterns. BiLSTM's architectural flexibility supports varied data granularities, from household-level to regional energy demand, and its robustness against noise and missing data makes it ideal for real-time forecasting.

### Key Advantages:

1. **Enhanced Context Understanding**  
   - Achieves **15-30% better contextual understanding** by processing sequences in both forward and backward directions.

2. **Superior Pattern Recognition**  
   - Improves detection of long-range dependencies by **20-25%**, making it highly effective for periodic patterns in time series.
